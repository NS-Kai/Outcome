It has its own calculate method to know when and what these value is. For example, <code>rgb (186,85,211)</code> can be know as color MediumOrchid. Its hexadecimal will be need all three value of rgb. Red has 186 value, so divide it by 16, and we can get 11.625. Take the integer of 11, it is same value as B. 0.625 will be multiple by 16 again, so we can get 10, which same value as A. Same goes with green and blue value, so we can get BA55D3, which is the color MediumOrchid.
